[autodiscovery]
scan network on mac adresses
    -> sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB/{print ip}'
sudo is important otherwise you don't see mac adresses

raspberry pi foundation is assigned these mac ranges :
B8:27:EB:xx:xx:xx
DC:A6:32:xx:xx:xx
E4:5F:01:xx:xx:xx

multiple awk substitues ?

sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB|DC:A6:32|E4:5F:01/{print ip}'



structure for autodiscovery
    -> check dependencies on host machine
    -> scan network for pi ip's
    -> get hardware version [cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/model]
        -> how does clean install react to this ?
    -> display all found pi's and pick master and remove unwanted
    -> write master and workers to inventory

    -> cont playbook



install/run instructions:
    -prepare raspberry pi's
        -flash os to sd card
        -boot pi
        -ssh to it and change password
        -setup keyauth
